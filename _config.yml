          Web application used by scorekeepers in the Ottawa/Gatineau Region to mark hockey games in real time. Built in pure React, this project was a great way to learn how to make a web app from scratch. I learned a lot about user experience and how to make an application simple to use. It is still in use today.

          Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
