          Web application used by scorekeepers in the Ottawa/Gatineau Region to mark hockey games in real time. Built in pure React, this project was a great way to learn how to make a web app from scratch. I learned a lot about user experience and how to make an application simple to use. It is still in use today.

          Simple web store for nurseries to sell their products. First project I made using the MERN stack. I learned a lot about how to make a full stack web app. I also learned a lot about how to make a good looking website and how to make it user friendly.
